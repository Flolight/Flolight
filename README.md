Software Engineer building stuff in the Cloud.

I share my tech experiments, mostly about Cloud (AWS, Azure...) and DevOps, but I'm also very curious about a lot of other topics.

Best example, my fun hobby: Stage lighting design!


I'm building my online presence with my [Blog](https://blog.flolight.dev/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FlolightC) account to share what I learn on my journey.

I'm also writing about how to start learning about Cloud: ["Please, Draw Me Some Clouds!"](https://pleasedrawmesomeclouds.flolight.dev/)
